Now we are going to create a new VPC, Fargate cluster, Application Load Balancer (ALB), Docker repostiory (ECR), ElastiCache and RDS deployments using a
CloudFormation template.


Click the "Launch" button below to begin (takes ~ ten minutes to run):

| Launch template |  |  |
| ------ |:------:|:--------:|
| VPC + Fargate + ECR + RDS + ElastiCache + ALB |  {{% cf-launch "stack.cfn.yml" "workshop" %}} | {{% cf-download "stack.cfn.yml" %}}  |

You can use the defaults or change the items as you like. By default, this will create an [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) instance running Redis and an [Amazon Relational Database Service](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) (RDS) instance running PostgreSQL.

If you select "prod" in the environment variable, the template will create a [Multi-AZ](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/multi-az/) RDS deployment and a two node ElastiCache cluster.

Change the options as you like for the workshop and then see the following image for instructions on submitting the form and beginning the stack creation process.

To create the stack, you need to click the checkbox and then the "Create stack" button.

Once you have started the stack creation process, it will take approximately eight minutes to complete. When your stack is created,
you will see a status of "CREATE_COMPLETE" as shown in the image below.
